## What is this?
It is a Bourne shell script.

Using this to remove all jailbreak files

!! DO NOT USE THIS IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING !!
This is not recommended by Coolstar or Pwn20wnd.

## How to use?
1. Uninstall ALL __user__ installed packages and tweaks. You can use SemiRestore11-lite for this now!
2. Put DeUnc0ver.sh on your phone. I'd recommend putting it in / (root) so it will be removed by itself
3. Reboot your device and rejailbreak _without_ tweaks enabled. (This should make the process more stable)
4. SSH into your phone as __root__ and run DeUnc0ver.sh from this repo:

```
cd /
sh DeUnc0ver.sh
```

5. Wait until the device reboots and then reboot again.
